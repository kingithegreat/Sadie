# DEV-ONLY: Example .env file for local development. Do NOT include a real
# .env in release artifacts. The preflight script will block builds that
# include dangerous flags like SADIE_E2E or SADIE_DIRECT_OLLAMA.
#
# Copy this to `.env` during development and set values as needed.

# Example entries:
# SADIE_DIRECT_OLLAMA=true
# OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
