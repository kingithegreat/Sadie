SADIE Test Document
This is a sample document used for automated testing of the SADIE document summary pipeline.

The purpose of this file is to verify:
- File detection
- Router enforcement
- Document parsing
- Summary generation

This ensures:
• Enough content to generate a non-trivial summary
• Predictable structure
• No whitespace-only or blank files that would cause failures
